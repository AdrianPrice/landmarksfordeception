Extracting landmarks using Pyperplan
- Basic implementation of intersections between landmarks of different goals in a pandas dataframe.
- Can iterate through different planning problems and extract landmarks.
- Toy problem in experiments/raw/Problem1
TODO:
- Store the data somewhere.
- Implement the idea of a candidate goal/real goal
- Test on some larger datasets.
ISSUES:
- The PDDL parser might not work with equality? Had issues running datasets from Ramon's datasets.
