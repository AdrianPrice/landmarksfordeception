### Python script for planning between landmarks
Run /pyperplan-master/src/partialLandmarkPlanner.py for creating a plan between two different landmarks in a problem.

Run /pyperplan-master/src/testLandmarks.py for extracting landmarks from a folder of problems. 

#### TODO 
Reorganisize folder structure and reliances so that code just needs pyperplan imported rather than directly extending from pyperplan codebase.
